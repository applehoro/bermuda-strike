Those bastards experiment on humans now!
Lets show them!

Emily:
Don't ask twice!

### Outro
The hideous terrifying beast was slain and was lying on the floor.

It's better not to think of those unfortunate souls beyond help.
Better think of the ones you can save.
If only you keep it right until the very end of the road.

### 5. Park "Sakura Fall"
Becky:
Yeah, the trees are so beautiful this time of the year!

Emily:
Too bad we can't watch 'em 'cause there's aliens all around to kill.

Becky:
Maybe, when we're done with all this, we could go out and drink sake and watch the Sakura fall together.
That would be nice!

Emily:
Oh, what, your asian genetic memory speaking?

Becky:
Probably. I just feel so nostalgic about peaceful times of the past.

Hey, if we'll do our job properly, there's a chance for peaceful times in future too.

Becky:
Hey, I've come up with a joke!
Knock-knock!

Emily:
Who's there?

Becky:
There's a lot of alien highs around here.
I wonder if it's some sort of command center?

Emily:
Not a funny joke.

Becky:
I wasn't telling the joke.
Geez, can you follow a simple conversation?

Emily:
You changed the subject right in the middle.

Becky:
Citicen Cane from arcane hurricane!

Emily:
What?

That's a joke!
What's not to understand?

I'm lost now.

Good.
Now unlost yourself and kick alien asses!

Emily:
No problem!

### 3. Storage "Boxed"
Becky:
Hey, guess what?
We're out of coffe at HQ now!

Emily:
And I'm out of clue where I am now!

Looks like storage area.
And looks like there could be something useful in the boxes.
Unlike me when I'm out of caffeine!
What a nightmare!

Emily:
Yeah, you tell me!

### 4. Engine bay "Full Throttle"
Becky:
By the way, I just wrote the word "Dummy" on my palm with a pen.

Right!

Arrrgh!
I've been wandering in these halls for hours now!
Any idea where I'm going?

Hey, by some luck you are nearby alien queen's throne room!

Emily:
Oh, really?

Becky:
Yeah, let's not waste the time and cut the head of the snake!

Emily:
Already used that phrase.

Becky:
How about end it right here right now?
Put the last stop in the story?
Push it to the breaking point?

Emily:
That's about breaking stuff, not finishing the job.

Becky:
Well, we're gonna break a lot of stuff anyways!

Emily:
Danm right, let's dance!

### Outro
Alien queen was as dead as a soul of corporate worker.
Strange sensation went through the air.
Aliens lost.
Humanity won.
Emily pack her stuff and gone back home.

No more war.
I guess our girls could watch the sakura fall in peace after all.
Rebuilding the Earth would be a long process, but the hope is in the air this spring.
