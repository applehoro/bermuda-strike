### 5. Park "Sakura Fall"
Becky:
Yeah, the trees are so beautiful this time of the year!

Emily:
Too bad we can't watch 'em 'cause there's aliens all around to kill.

Becky:
Maybe, when we're done with all this, we could go out and drink sake and watch the Sakura fall together.
That would be nice!

Emily:
Oh, what, your asian genetic memory speaking?
