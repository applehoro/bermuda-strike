# Jet Girls
(title is very temporary and will be changed in the future)

An areial jet-powered shooter game made in Godot Engine.
Inspired mainly by Strike Witches anime.

## Project state

Right now the project is in its very beginning, nothing to show yet.
Some menus, options, single test level and some player-related stuff.
Although, some eye candy, just to determine the broad visual style.

## Attack plan
(not exactly roadmap, more like definition of priorities)

1. The very first priority right now is making the basic gameplay elements.
This includes weapons, pickups, enemies, interactive level elements, menus, and stuff like that.

2. When it'll be done, the second priority is to just fill the game with content.
Basically more levels, enemies, guns, sound and music, story.

3. Lastly, there's some fancy elements that would be nice to have, like cutscenes, cosmetics, tutorials and probably something else.
It's not guaranteed to be completed or even started at all, but it would be nice to have.

## Contributions

Yes, contributions will be welcomed, but with few caveats.

1. As a creator of the project, I reserve my right to decide the project's direction, goals and overall design.
2. As a creator of the project, I reserve my right to decide, what contributions to accept and to decline (Although, probably most of them should be accepted anyways)
3. All contributions to project must be made under the same license (see LICENSE)
